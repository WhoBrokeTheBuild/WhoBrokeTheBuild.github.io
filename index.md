I'm just a programmer who hates themself enough to use C on a regular basis. I have dozens of half-finished projects on GitHub, most of which are pretty interesting. I build Game Engines and Emulators for fun. Check out my <a href="/blog.html">blog<a> for updates on my projects, and the numberous bugs I run into with them.
